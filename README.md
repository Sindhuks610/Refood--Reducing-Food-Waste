Project Title: ReFood – Nourishing Communities, Sustainable Futures.
My Role- Team Leader (Desiging the NGO and Donar page).
Food wastage continues to be a significant global issue, particularly in urban areas where surplus food from restaurants, events, and households is frequently discarded. Meanwhile, millions of people remain undernourished or food-insecure. ReFood seeks to address this imbalance by creating a digital platform that efficiently connects food donors with NGOs and individuals in need. The initiative is grounded in the idea of reducing food waste while ensuring timely redistribution to underprivileged communities.

Objectives
• To minimize food waste through effective redistribution. • To facilitate real-time connections between food donors and NGOs/volunteers. • To build awareness about sustainable food practices. • To create a scalable and replicable model for food sharing.

Workflow:
Donor uploads surplus food details.
NGOs/Volunteers are alerted via the app.
Collection and distribution take place in a timely and safe manner.
Tracking and feedback loops ensure transparency and accountability.
